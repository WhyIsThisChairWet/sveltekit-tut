    Some females stay and defend the nest until the chicks start hatching, but
    most leave the nesting area completely to nest again; in a good season, a
    female emu may nest three times. In the areas in which it was endemic, the
    emu was an important source of meat to Aboriginal Australians. They used the
    fat as bush medicine and rubbed it into their skin. It served as a valuable
    lubricant, was used to oil wooden tools and utensils such as the coolamon,
    and was mixed with ochre to make the traditional paint for ceremonial body
    adornment. Emus are around all the time, in green times and dry times. You
    pluck the feathers out first, then pull out the crop from the stomach, and
    put in the feathers you've pulled out, and then singe it on the fire. You
    wrap the milk guts that you've pulled out into something The Salem district
    administration in India advised farmers in 2012 not to invest in the emu
    business which was being heavily promoted at the time; further investigation
    was needed to assess the profitability of farming the birds in India.
    Trademarks of early Australian companies using the emu included Webbenderfer
    Bros frame mouldings (1891), Mac Robertson Chocolate and Cocoa (1893),
    Dyason and Son Emu Brand Cordial Sauce (1894), James Allard Pottery Wares
    (1906), and rope manufacturers G. Kinnear and Sons Pty. Ltd. still use it on
    some of their products.cloth
