    Fire has also been used for centuries as a method of torture and execution,
    as evidenced by death by burning as well as torture devices such as the iron
    boot, which could be filled with water, oil, or even lead and then heated
    over an open fire to the agony of the wearer. There are numerous modern
    applications of fire. In its broadest sense, fire is used by nearly every
    human being on earth in a controlled setting every day. Users of internal
    combustion vehicles employ fire every time they drive. Thermal power
    stations provide electricity for a large percentage of humanity by igniting
    fuels such as coal, oil or natural gas, then using the resultant heat to
    boil water into steam, which then drives turbines. The unburnable solid
    remains of a combustible material left after a fire is called clinker if its
    melting point is below the flame temperature, so that it fuses and then
    solidifies as it cools, and ash if its melting point is above the flame
    temperature. Wildfire prevention programs around the world may employ
    techniques such as wildland fire use and prescribed or controlled burns.
    Fire fighting services are provided in most developed areas to extinguish or
    contain uncontrolled fires. Trained firefighters use fire apparatus, water
    supply resources such as water mains and fire hydrants or they might use A
    and B class foam depending on what is feeding the fire.
